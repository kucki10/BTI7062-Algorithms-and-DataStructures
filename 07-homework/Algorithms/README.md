## Instructions
Execute these instructions inside the extracted folder in "code".

### Build

```
> mkdir bin
> javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/main/*.java
> mkdir bin/main/view
> cp src/main/view/Application.fxml bin/main/view/Application.fxml
```

### Generate JAR-File
```
> cd bin
> jar cfe Application.jar main.Main .
> java -jar Application.jar
```


### Already builded version
Under the folder "code/bin/prebuilt", there is already a builded version. <br />
You just need to rename the extension to "jar". <br />
If the bin folder is empty, the Mail Server removed the built.
You can also download the builded version under:
https://github.com/kucki10/BTI7062-Algorithms-and-DataStructures/tree/master/07-homework/Algorithms/bin <br />
