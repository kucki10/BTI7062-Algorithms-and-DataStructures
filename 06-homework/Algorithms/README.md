## Source Code
The source code can be seen on the public repostiory:

## Instructions
Execute these instructions inside the extracted folder in "code". 
In order to build the application correctly, the dependency "Commons-lang" needs to be present. <br/>
So therefore rename the file in "code/lib" to commons-lang3-3.0.1.jar. <br />
If there is no file inside this folder, it got removed by the Mail Server
You can manually download it from here: 
http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/commons/commons-lang3/3.0.1/commons-lang3-3.0.1.jar


### Build
On windows use  ; in -cp as separator <br />
On other OS use : in -cp as separator

```
> mkdir bin
> javac -d bin -cp ".;./lib/commons-lang3-3.0.1.jar" -sourcepath src src/main/*.java
> mkdir bin\main\view
> cp src/main/view/Application.fxml bin/main/view/Application.fxml
> cp lib/commons-lang3-3.0.1.jar bin/commons-lang3-3.0.1.jar
```
### Run
On windows use  ; in -cp as separator <br />
On other OS use : in -cp as separator
```
> java -cp "bin;bin/commons-lang3-3.0.1.jar" main.Main
```

### Generate JAR-File
```
> cd bin
> jar cvfm MergeSort.jar ../MANIFEST.mf .
> java -jar MergeSort.jar
```


### Already builded version
Under the folder "code/bin/prebuilt", there is already a builded version. <br />
You just need to rename the extension to "jar". <br />
If the bin folder is empty, the Mail Server removed the built.
You can also download the builded version under:
https://github.com/kucki10/BTI7062-Algorithms-and-DataStructures/tree/master/06-homework/Algorithms/bin <br />
Make sure both jars are downloaded.
